// Coding Challenge #1

/*
Nur and Neha are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meter).

1. Store Nur's and Neha's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both versions)
3. Create a boolean variable 'NurHigherBMI' containing information about whether Nur has a higher BMI than Neha.
TEST DATA 1: Nurs weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. Neha weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.
TEST DATA 2: Nurs weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. Neha weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.

// Coding Challenge #2

/*
Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it:

1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message can be either "Nur's BMI is higher than Neha's!" or "Neha's BMI is higher than Nur's!"
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Nur's BMI (28.3) is higher than Neha's (23.9)!"
HINT: Use an if/else statement ðŸ˜‰
